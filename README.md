Results
-------
In the Vision Scope project, various Machine learning models were employed to classify retinal images into four major eye disease categories. The models tested included a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0, all trained on a balanced dataset of eye images. Among them, EfficientNetB0 demonstrated the best performance, achieving a validation accuracy of approximately 90% and a test accuracy of 89%, surpassing the other architectures. In comparison, the custom CNN reached around 80% validation accuracy, while InceptionResNetV2 and ResNet50 achieved approximately 88% and 85% respectively. The training and validation loss curves indicated that EfficientNetB0 not only performed well but also converged efficiently with minimal overfitting, suggesting strong generalization capabilities.
Further analysis through visualizations supported these findings. Class distribution plots confirmed a balanced dataset, while accuracy and loss graphs showed consistent training behavior across epochs. A confusion matrix generated using EfficientNetB0 predictions illustrated reliable classification across all disease categories, with no significant bias toward any class. Additionally, the classification report reflected high performance with precision, recall, and F1-scores all exceeding 85%. Test sample predictions showed high confidence levels, often surpassing 90%, further validating the model's reliability. Overall, these results affirm Vision Scopeâ€™s effectiveness as a robust diagnostic tool for early and accurate detection

Conclusion
----------
The Vision Scope project successfully demonstrated the potential of deep learning and transfer learning models in classifying eye diseases such as glaucoma, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, and normal retinal images. Among the models tested, EfficientNetB0 delivered the highest performance, achieving an accuracy of 92.71%, along with strong precision and recall scores. These results confirm the hypothesis that deep learning models, especially those fine-tuned with transfer learning, can effectively assist in medical image classification tasks. While some misclassifications occurred, the overall model reliability and confidence scores support its use as a diagnostic aid. For future work, expanding the dataset and applying explainable AI methods could improve model transparency and trust.
